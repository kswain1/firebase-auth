All course files for the Firebase authentication tutorial series on The Net Ninja YouTube channel.

Firebase Basics: 
1. Website/Mobile App Form (with firebase sdk) communicates with server login credentials
2. Firebase server sends back a token to your client or website/Mobile app 
3. On future request from other request we can determine what information the users see's based on it's token. Where each data collection or data can be protected or pulled based on the collection id from the token
4. Firebase also uses a method on the web call persist where the token is cached or stored locally on client(users) device in order to remove the need for constant pinging back and foward to gather the token information from the user.
